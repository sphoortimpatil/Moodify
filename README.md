It's a website developed to stream music from Spotify according to the mood of the user. The user needs to give an image input which is then evaluated to detect approximate mood with Face-api.js package. React is used for front-end and axios is used for making api calls. This project mainly concentrates on using Spotify-api and Face-api.js .
